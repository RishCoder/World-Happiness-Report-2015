# World-Happiness-Report-2015

This project was done by me in the month of May 2020. Here i have used R as a programming language to do explore, clean and perform EDA.

I used WHR 2015 dataset here. It has total 12 columns including country, region, happiness score, etc. 

World happiness report is published by United Nations each year. The first WHR was published on March 20, 2012 by UN. It ranked 155 countries by their happiness level. 

more about this can be found here https://worldhappiness.report/

In this analysis, I have found which countries are happiest, which are the most unhappy, which continent is happiest, etc. 

The reason behind selecting the 2015 dataset was that it contained more data that WHR 2019.

The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors â€“ economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.

the inspiration behind this project was that I wanted to test my newly learned skills and I wanted good, not-so-used-dataset. 

I hope you like it. 

Suggestions are comments are welcomed.

Enjoy!!
